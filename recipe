1. Crack the eggs into a bowl and beat until creamy. Add in the dry ingredients (excluding the salt and baking soda if using self-rising flour). Do not stir mixture at this point!

2.Melt the butter in a microwave-safe bowl. Make sure that it's completely melted; about a minute is sufficient.

3.Add the butter and milk to the mix. Stir gently, leaving some small clumps of dry ingredients in the batter. Do not blend until completely smooth. If your batter is smooth, your pancakes will be tough and flat as opposed to fluffy.
If using vanilla extract, you can add it to the mix alongside the butter and milk.

4.Heat the frying pan to a medium low flame. If you have an initial "pancake" setting on your stove, use that. Be sure to use non-stick spray, or a pat of butter so the pancakes won't stick.

5.Sprinkle a few flecks of water onto your pan. If it 'dances', or jumps from the pan with a sizzle, the pan is ready for the batter.

6.Pour about 3 tablespoons to 1/4 cup batter from the tip of a large spoon or from a pitcher onto the hot griddle or greased frying pan. The amount you pour will decide the final size of your pancakes. It is best to begin with less batter, and then slowly pour more batter onto the pan to increase the pancake size.

7.Cook for about two minutes or until the pancake is golden. You should see bubbles form and then pop around the edges. When the bubbles at the edge of the batter pop and a hole is left that does not immediately close up, flip the cake gently.[2]

8.Cook the other side until golden and remove. Want a deeper color? Repeat the steps for another thirty seconds per side until the pancake is done enough for your tastes.

9.Enjoy! Try adding butter, peanut butter, syrup, jelly, chocolate chips, cookies, candy crumbles or fruit to your pancakes for a different, more exciting flavor. The varieties are endless. These are the most delectable pancakes you will ever taste.
